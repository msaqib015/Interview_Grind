# 📊 Statistics Interview Grind

Welcome to the **Statistics Interview Grind** — a complete and structured prep guide to master the most commonly asked statistics questions in **Data Science**, **Analytics**, **ML**, and **Research** interviews.

This project contains **detailed answers to the top 50 interview questions**, focusing on both **theory** and **real-world intuition**, making it an ideal companion for job aspirants in data-focused roles.

## 🎯 Project Goal

- Build a solid understanding of key statistics concepts.
- Provide clear explanations with real-world examples.
- Prepare effectively for technical interviews in data-centric careers.
- Create a reference base for last-minute revision and teaching purposes.

## 🧠 Sample Question Examples

> **Q: What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important?**  
> A: The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution. It's critical for hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and predictive modeling.

> **Q: How are p-values interpreted in hypothesis testing?**  
> A: A p-value represents the probability of obtaining the observed results assuming the null hypothesis is true. A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
